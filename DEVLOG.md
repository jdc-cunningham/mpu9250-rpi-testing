Forgot how I have to do all this `wpa_supplicant` and `ssh` stuff when setting up the Pi.
The Pi also has male headers ugh.

Minimum goals today are to see the values reflect my physical movements. Then start to work out the rotation. Will start with a box moving based on IMU position.

Hopefully can display it live to a web app that has a socket running/showing D3 JS.
